## Bullet 5 of Sprint 0 - Technical Issues

Here we can create a django project and add a simple feature to fulfill bullet 5 of spring 0.

This is the description from Piazza:

Bullet 5 of Sprint 0
 
You'll have identified several technical issues that you think you might need for your project, and have team members (perhaps in pairs) explore who to solve those technical issues. (Put these under version control, but do not make them part of your main GitHub repo for the Project. They could even be separate public repos. Think of these as throw-away prototypes to help you learn technologies.) We'll ask to see demos of these in lab next week
 
To clarify, we decided that you need to create a django project and add a simple feature. Ex: a simple form with validation. This is due in NEXT lab.
